\o/ Hello! This is what I was working on for a while now. <a href="https://mspfa.com/?s=24896&p=1">A News Posts JS Lib for MSPFA users.</a> And also a new theme for INTERVENE. But it might not be the only one soon.

I don't want to say any excuses so I'll keep this post short. There are INTERVENE updates coming but not for a while. Because Life and Jobs and Food Stamps. If you particularly want to help make INTERVENE happen faster all I have right now is a <a href="ko-fi.com/lylacsys">ko-fi donation link.</a> The next update is planned to have a short set a panels, followed by a FLASH made entirely in javascript.

Why is a Flash animation being made in Javascript and not Animate CC/Flash? And why am I still using 'Flash' terminology instead of &lt;canvas&gt; like I'm expected to? Only google knows :^)<br>
